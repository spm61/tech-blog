  ## Description:
  This web application demonstrates a basic technical blog with authentication functionality and the ability to create and delete posts.

  ## Installation:
  Make sure that node and MySQL are installed on your machine.  Then clone the git repo so you have the files locally.  In a command prompt in the project directory, log into mysql and run sources db/schema.sql. You'll need to create a .env file to cotain DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME values and save it to the project directory.   Next, still in a command prompt but not in MySQL, run node seeds/index.js to seed the database.  Then, run npm i to get all the packages.  Finally run npm start to actually start the server.

  ## Usage:
  After completing the installation instructions, go to a web browser and go to localhost:3001 to access the website.  All the central functionalities can be accessed by clicking on the relevant links.
